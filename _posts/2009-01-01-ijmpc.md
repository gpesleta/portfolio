**Abstract.** We investigate the interplay of damage accumulation and structural reinforcement in the fatigue failure of a two-dimensional mass-spring system. Damage accumulation is captured in the model such that the damage of a spring at a certain time depends on its entire deformation history. Structural reinforcement, on the other hand, is implemented by increasing the breaking thresholds of the springs [Esleta and Monterola, Comp. Phys. Comm. 20081]. We demonstrate that consistent with known empirical laws, in the presence of memory, the lifetime tf of the system subjected to a stress amplitude $$\sigma_0$$ is a power law ($$t_f ~\sim \sigma_0^{-\gamma}$$) . As damage accumulation memory $$f_0$$ is incorporated into the system, the transition from non-power law ($f_0 = 0$, no memory) to power law distribution is observed. Preservation of the power law behavior (equal value of $$\gamma$$) is guaranteed even when the system's lifetime is prolonged through static reinforcement. Finally, our model demonstrates that strengthening the stress memory of spring elements leads to more scattered crack patterns, a result that agrees phenomenologically with existing experiments.
