## Abstract

The global travel and tourism industry contributes over $8.8 trillion and 319 million jobs to the global economy. Affordable travel has created a boom for some economies, with over 1.4 billion international travelers, but has also brought its own set of challenges. For travelers, it is all about identifying the next best destination. **airbnbnb** solves this dilemma by suggesting the user's next destination based on his travel history. It leverages the transactions of other Airbnb users to provide collaborative-based destination recommendations. It uses **125 Gigabytes** of data from [www.insideairbnb.com](http://www.insideairbnb.com),  an independent, non-commercial site that allows researchers to explore how Airbnb is used in cities around the world. The *Inside Airbnb* dataset contains reviews of **26.7 million Airbnb users**, and covers listings from **101 cities** across **30 countries**. Two types of recommender systems were explored: one uses association rules, while the other is a collaborative-based recommender system implemented using Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm. The collaborative-based destination recommender was successful in providing destination suggestions, having achieved a root mean square error of 0.019 for city recommendations, and 0.017 for country recommendations.  

## DATA DESCRIPTION

The dataset was obtained from [www.insideairbnb.com](http://www.insideairbnb.com), an independent, non-commercial site that allows researchers to explore how Airbnb is used in cities around the world. Data from _Inside Airbnb_ was scraped from publicly available information from the [Airbnb site](http://www.airbnb.com). The total size of the dataset is **125 Gigabytes**.

The Inside Airbnb dataset contains reviews of **26.7 million Airbnb users**, and covers listings from **101 cities** across **30 countries**.

## METHODOLOGY

Their Airbnbnb destination recommender system leverages on the reviews provided by the Airbnb guests. The reviews are contained in comma-separated value (CSV) files (`reviews.csv.gz`).

[Table 1](#table1) shows the data description of the `reviews.csv.gz` file:

#### Figure 1. Workflow for building the destination recommender

The general workflow for creating the destination recommender as shown in Figure 1 involves the following steps. Each step will be discussed in detail in the succeeding sections.

1. Get list of `review.csv.gz` filepaths
2. Create vertical transaction database
3. Convert vertical transaction database to horizontal transaction database
4. Association rule mining
5. Association-rule based recommender system
6. Collaborative-based recommender system

## RESULTS

### A. City Association Rules

Sample city association rules with the highest lift are as follows:

!['Ottawa']({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/assoc_rules_ottawa.png)
#### Figure 4. The association rule {Quebec, Montreal Toronto} ->  Ottawa has a 49x lift. 

!['Stockholm']({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/assoc_rules_stockholm.png)
#### Figure 5. The association rule {Oslo, Copenhagen} -> Stockhol has a 32x lift. 

### B. Country Association Rules

Sample country association rules with the highest lifts are shown below:

!['Austria']({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/assoc_rules_austria.png)
#### Figure 6. The association rule {Czech Republic, Germany} -> Austria has a 10.4x lift. 

!['France']({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/assoc_rules_france.png)
#### Figure 7. The association rule {Netherlands, Spain, Italy} -> France has a 3.9x lift. 

## INSIGHTS AND CONCLUSION

Leveraging millions of user reviews allows **airbnbnb** to generate relevant recommendations based on travel history. A closer look at the recommendations reveal that it often suggests logical pairs of destinations. For example, a city recommender will recommend another city within the same country. Or a country recommender will recommend a neighboring country within the same region. 

The collaborative-based destination recommendation proved to be successful in recommending new destinations to users, having achieves a low root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.019 for city recommendations and 0.017 for country recommendations.

While the results may seem intuitive, access to more user and travel (i.e. more countries and cities) data will yield more robust recommender systems. This system presents a good foundation to build on.
