## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
A bill filed in the Philippine House of Representatives (HOR) can have one or more authors. This network of co-authors can shed information about the underlying communities and collaborations among congressmen. Bill authorship data for the 17th and 18th Congress were obtained from the [HOR’s Legislative Information System](http://www.congress.gov.ph/legis) to map out the bill co-authorship network, and the Louvain method was used to detect the underlying community structure. The communities were found to be consistent with political bloc membership and not with other demographic factors such as gender and regional affiliation. The betweenness centrality of a congressman is correlated with the number of co-authored bills that reached the third and final reading. Hence, “connectedness” by virtue of betweenness centrality, not political prominence, can be a proxy for legislative success and the capacity for a representative to pass more bills on the floor.

## INTRODUCTION
The Philippines follows the worldwide trend of political changes in 2016 when then Davao Mayor Rodrigo Duterte stepped in as President of the Republic. The political system was shocked when leadership was replaced by a ‘new’ set of elites. Majority suddenly became the minority, and the minority as the majority – later turned to ‘supermajority’ from three pioneering congressmen from PDP-Laban (i.e., the President's political party). As such, commentators and political experts argue that 2016 has been one of the most controversial years in the post-1986 political landscape in the country.

Bloc switching in the political arena was not limited to the executive branch. In fact, this also affected the legislature that caused politicians to realign priorities with the national bureaucracy. When a new leader is elected to office, members of the Congress, especially in the lower house, change their party to associate with the party of the president to leverage on appropriating funds for their district or secure committee chairpersonship. As for the Philippines, the existence of a ‘supermajority’ in congress is more palpable in the lower congress. Compared to the Senate with a loose coalition, the HOR comprised of at least 80% supermajority for both the 17th and 18th congress. 

The supermajority in the lower congress is critical for the President for the HOR is entrusted with the power to introduce money bills (e.g., taxation) and the power to impeach. This gives him in a strategic political position to push through controversial political agendas (e.g., death penalty, low age of criminal liability). 

The necessity to join the majority bloc demonstrates that there is a popular perception that being well connected is an important part of legislative life, but what exactly does it mean to be connected? Does this supermajority grouping help congressmen pass bills? and can we measure this connection to determine legislators who are well connected?

Typical social network studies rely on survey questionnaires and interviews. However, these data provide limited information about a subset of people and are based on subjective evaluation of what constitute a social connection. With network science, this research will explore the HOR’s connection in terms of co-authorship of bills to discover underlying connections and communities in the Philippine lower congress. In doing such, the following questions will be answered:
1. Can we uncover underlying communities in the PH HOR using the authorship collaboration network?
2. Are these grouping affected by factors such as geography, gender, and bloc?
3. How can a legislator increase his/her chances of having a proposed bill approved?

## METHODOLOGY

### Construction of Legislative Co-authorship graph
The bipartite graph was then projected onto the congressmen nodes C  to construct the weighted, undirected bill co-authorship graph. A connection exists between two congressmen if they co-authored at least one bill together, with the weight of the connection equal to the number of co-authored bills. The resulting co-authorship networks for the 17th and 18th Congress are shown in [Figure 1](#fig1) and [Figure 2](#fig2).

Nodes are connected if they co-authored the same bill, with the width of each link being proportional to the weighted number of bills co-authored. Node colors represent the various communities identified through community detection. Figure drawn using Gephi.

## RESULTS

### Community Structure

#### Figure 3. Community structure of the co-authorship network of the 17th and 18th Congress. Nodes are colored based on congressmen's political affiliation. Figure drawn using Gephi.

To identify the underlying community structures in the co-authorship network, community detection was implemented using the Louvain algorithm created by Blondel et al. The optimal communities were then identified by maximizing the modularity, which measures the density of links inside communities as compared to links between communities. Shown in [Figure 3](#fig3) are the detected communities, with the nodes colored based on congressmen attributes such as gender, regional affiliation, and bloc membership. It is evident that the formation of communities in the co-authorship network are primarily based on political affiliation and are not driven by other demographic factors such as gender and regional affiliation.  


### Centrality and Legislative Success

Finally, we want to investigate if a congressman’s centrality in the co-authorship network is related to his legislative success or his ability to pass bills. [Figure 4](#fig4) shows the high-level legislative process within the House of Representatives. A bill filed by a congressman must go through several steps before it becomes approved on third reading and transmitted to the Senate. We define the legislative success of a congressman as the number of co-authored bills that reached the third reading.

#### Legislative process in the House of Representatives. For the purposes of this work, the legislative success of a congressman is defined as the number of co-authored bills that reached the third reading.

The centrality of a congressman in the co-authorship network centrality is correlated with legislative success. For each congressman, we computed for the number of bills that reached third reading, observing moderate to strong correlation with betweenness centrality as shown in [Figure 5](#fig5). A similar result was shown by Fowler on his analysis of the US Senate and Congress co-sponsorship network using a weighted closeness centrality measure called “connectedness”. The centrality of a congressman in the co-authorship network is thus indicative of his capacity to get the approval of the Congress and push his legislative agenda forward. Network effects play a role in influencing a congressman’s legislative success.

#### Legislative success versus betweenness centrality. The relationship between the number of approved bills and betweenness centrality show a Spearman's correlation of 0.7 for the 17th Congress and 0.6 for the 18th Congress. 

## CONCLUSIONS
In this work we analyzed the legislative co-authorship network of the Philippine House of Representatives under the Duterte administration. The underlying communities are political in nature and are not driven by other demographic attributes such as gender and regional affiliation. We found that a representative’s legislative success in the Lower Congress is correlated with Betweenness Centrality but unrelated to one’s political prominence. Correspondingly, it is noted that members of the minority can still achieve legislative success provided they increase their betweenness, or by acting as a bridge between the minority and majority such in the case of Representative Bordado of Camarines Sur. In conclusion, centrality is reflective of a congressman’s ability to pass bills and convince colleagues to move a bill forward.
